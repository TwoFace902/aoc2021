we're guaranteed each digit so you can figure out right side via
1 gives you 'cf'
4 gives you 'bdcf'
7 gives you 'acf'

comparing 1 to 7 and taking the odd one out gives you the mapping to 'a'.
knowing 'a', add the premapped 'a' to 4 and check if it's substring of length 6 boy. it will not be 6 because of 'c'. It will not be 0 because of 'd'.
so the odd one out of the compared 4 + 'a' and the two length 6s will give us the mapping to 'g'.
knowing 'a' and 'g', add both of those to 4 to get one off of 8. then the odd one out will be mapping to 'e'.
knowing 'a' and 'g', add both of those to 1 to get one off of 3. then the odd one out will be mapping to 'd'.
knowing 'd', add it to 1 to get one off of 4. then the odd one out will be mapping to 'b'.

now all we need is the mapping to 'c' and 'f'. you can use 2,5,6 to get this.
remove mapped abdeg from 6 to get 'f'. you now know what 'c' is by process of elimination.
